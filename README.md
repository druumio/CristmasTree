[<img src="https://github.com/druumio/CristmasTree/blob/main/Images/tree.jpeg" width="200"/>]()

Current idea is to have PC control leds trough ble

Might change it to ESP host website for local network instead

Phone app would be ideal, but I have Iphone and my parents android, so that is just too much work
